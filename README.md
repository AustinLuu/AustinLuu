Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a curious Mechatronics Engineer interested in ML, robotics, and accessible tech &mdash; anything that can make tech work better for everyone. Currently, I'm based in Toronto, ON and studying Mechatronics Engineering [@RU](https://www.ryerson.ca/programs/undergraduate/mechanical-engineering/).

In my spare time, you can find me power lifting at the gym, shooting mediocre photos, or at your local beach playing volleyball! Recently, I've started a podcast on which I plan to talk more about some of my thoughts on tech, personal projects, and general musings about the world.
